            <section><h2>Pamukkale</h2>
                <p>
                Pamukkale has been a tourist resort since the 2nd Century AD when the Romans used it as a spa town.  A natural wonder with its hot springs and white (calcium) cliffs. At the top of the cliffs is the ancient city of Hieropoli which is worth seeing (the highlight being the impressive 12,000 seat Roman amphitheatre).

            <section><h2>Kappadocia</h2>
                <p>It is know for its moon-like landscape, underground cave cities and fairy chimneys. The thing to do here is taking a hot air balloon ride over the countryside. You should also stay in a Cave hotel, it’s something unique to the area.
